Work in progress. At the moment, the program is highly functional and useable, but there is still more work to do to make it more extensible and there is still a need for documentation in many areas.


NOTE: You need the JonUtility project in order to compile the code. This project can also be found in my repository. Use NuGet package auto-restore to add the missing NuGet packages. This project was made in Visual Studio 2015 and makes use of C# 6 features.
